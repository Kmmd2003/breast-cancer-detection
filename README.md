# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project applies various supervised machine learning algorithms to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant, using the classic `breast_cancer` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

## 📊 Algorithms Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Visualization
A comparative bar chart of all models is generated using Matplotlib, showing their respective performance across different metrics.

## 💡 Dataset
The dataset is preloaded from Scikit-learn and contains features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

## 📁 Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.7
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tensorflow / keras
- numpy, pandas

You can run the code on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) without needing to install anything locally.
